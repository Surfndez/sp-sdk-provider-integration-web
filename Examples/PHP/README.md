# ZenKey Example Application in PHP

This is an example application that demonstrates how to integrate ZenKey into a PHP web application. If you have not read the [Web Integration Guide](https://git.xcijv.net/mobiledevelopment/providerintegration-web/blob/master/README.md), read it before continuing.

## 1.0 Background

The example application is built using vanilla PHP. It uses [oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) as the OAuth 2.0 client.

Users can sign in using ZenKey via web browser. When authenticated, they can see their name.

## 2.0 Getting Started

The ZenKey example application uses a few PHP packages. To run the application, install the dependencies, then configure environment variables.

### 2.1 Dependencies

- [oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client)

### 2.2 Installation

Install dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
php composer.phar install
```

### 2.3 Configure Environment

Storing [configuration in the environment](http://12factor.net/config) is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://12factor.net).

If running locally, create and configure a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Otherwise, configure the environment variables in your server environment.

| Parameter        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
|`CLIENT_ID` | Your ZenKey `clientId` obtained from the SP Portal. |  
|`CLIENT_SECRET` | Your ZenKey `Client_Secret` obtained from the SP Portal.|
|`SECRET_KEY_BASE` | A randomly-generated key to encrypt sessions. |  
|`BASE_URL=`   |  The base domain of this application/ |
|  |  Example: For auth.myapp.com, use `maypp.com` as the domain value |  
|`DISCOVERY_URL` | https://discoveryui.myzenkey.com/ui/visual-code?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE |  

## 2.4 Running the Application

Deploy the application to your web server. Open `index.php` in a web browser.
