# Example Application in Java

This example application is for developers integrating ZenKey into their Java web application. If you have not read the [Web Integration Guide](https://git.xcijv.net/mobiledevelopment/providerintegration-web/blob/master/README.md), read it before continuing.

## 1.0 Background

This example application is built on the Java Spring framework powered by Maven. A user can log in and log out using ZenKey as its authentication provider. Upon successful authentication, the application receives and parses the `id_token` from the authentication response to display the user's full name.

## 2.0 Getting Started

The ZenKey example application uses various Java libraries. To run the application, add the libraries, then install the dependencies and configure environment variables.

### 2.1 Libraries Used

- [Java Spring + Security](https://spring.io/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks): used for parsing `jwks`

### 2.2 Installation

Requirements can be installed using Maven. There are several commands that will install dependencies for you, such as `mvn install`, `mvn package`, etc.

### 2.3 Environment Configuration

The `.env` file needs to be set up. Specific parameters can be found in the `.env.example` file, detailed below:

| Parameter        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
|`CLIENT_ID` | Your ZenKey `clientId` obtained from the SP Portal. |  
|`CLIENT_SECRET` | Your ZenKey `Client_Secret` obtained from the SP Portal.|
|`SECRET_KEY_BASE` | A randomly-generated key to encrypt sessions. |  
|`BASE_URL=`   |  The base domain of this application/ |
|  |  Example: For auth.myapp.com, use `maypp.com` as the domain value |  
|`DISCOVERY_URL` | https://discoveryui.myzenkey.com/ui/visual-code?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE |  

## 3.0 Running the Application

After installing the required dependencies and configuring the environment variables, use `JavademoApplication.java` as the entry point to run this application.

### 3.1 Parsing the `id_token`

After a user has successfully logged in, the `/user` endpoint in `UserController.java` is called to parse through the `id_token` in session. In the application, we demonstrate basic parsing by displaying the user's full name.
